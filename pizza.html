            <h2>Description</h2>
        </div>
        <div>Chicago-style pizza is pizza prepared according to one of several styles developed in Chicago. It can refer to both the well-known deep-dish or stuffed pizzas and the lesser-known thin-crust "tavern-style" pizzas. The pan used to bake deep-dish pizza gives the pizza its characteristically high edge, which provides ample space for lots of cheese and a chunky tomato sauce. Chicago-style deep-dish pizza may be prepared either this way or stuffed.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1 ½ teaspoons white sugar</li>
                <li>1 ⅛ cups warm water - 110 to 115 degrees F (43 to 45 degrees C)</li>
                <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>½ cup corn oil</li>
                <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Combine yeast mixture, flour, corn oil, and kosher salt in a large stand mixer fitted with the dough hook; knead until dough holds together but is still slightly sticky, about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Form dough into a ball and transfer to a buttered bowl. Turn to coat dough with butter, then cover the bowl with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 6 hours.</li>
                <li>Punch down dough and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Press dough into a 10-inch deep-dish pizza pan and follow your pizza recipe.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>To Make the Pizza:</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            Add cheese, toppings, and tomatoes that you've flavored with garlic, basil, oregano, etc. Bake the pizza in an oven preheated to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for about 30 minutes, depending on your oven. You can prebake the crust for 10-15 minutes before adding toppings if desired.
